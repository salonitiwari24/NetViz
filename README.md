## What I Did
Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** to explore Netflix content.  

Key visualizations include:
- Count of Movies vs TV Shows  
- Distribution of release years  
- Ratings distribution  
- Top 10 countries by content  
- Release year trends by type  
- Violin plots of release year by type  
- Scatter plot of release year vs duration (Movies only)  
- Average duration by rating (Movies only)  
- Heatmap (numerical correlations)  
- Pair plots (release year & duration)  
- Pie chart of content type distribution

## How to Run
1. Place `netflix_titles.csv` in the project root.  
2. Open `Plots.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.  
3. Run all cells â€” plots will be generated and saved into the `Screenshots/` folder.

## Files in this Repo
- `Plots.ipynb` â€” Jupyter Notebook with code, plots, and analysis.  
- `netflix_titles.csv` â€” Dataset file.  
- `Screenshots/` â€” Folder containing all saved plots.  
- `README.md` â€” Project documentation.  

---

## Next Steps
- Deeper analysis of **genre trends** across years.  
- Explore **directors and actors** to find the most frequent contributors.  
- Compare Netflixâ€™s growth with **competitors (Prime, Disney+, etc.)** if datasets are available.  
- Build an **interactive dashboard** to explore Netflixâ€™s catalog by type, year, country, and genre.
